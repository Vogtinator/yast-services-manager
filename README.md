# YaST Services Manager

[![Check](https://github.com/yast/yast-services-manager/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg?branch=check_systemd_states)](https://github.com/yast/yast-services-manager/actions/workflows/check.yml?query=branch%3Acheck_systemd_states)

This branch contains a script which regularly scans for the systemd
states in openSUSE Tumbleweed.

The goal is to find the changes in systemd early and adapt YaST for the changes
as fast as possible.
